:book:
:book: review and standardize documentation of arguments, *i.e.* always starts by a lower case letter, use
\code{}, everytime a value is mentions and \link{} anytime a function is mentioned.
:hammer: `frameit()` renamed `frameIt()` for the sack of naming consistency.
:hammer: `compassRose1()` and `compassRose2()` respectively renamed `compassRoseCardinal()` and `compassRose()`.
:hammer: `layout2()` renamed `interactiveLayout()` to better reflect what it does.
