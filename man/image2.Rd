\usage{
image2(x, from = NULL, to = NULL, color_scale = NULL, border = NA,
  ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a matrix or an object to be coerced as a matrix.}

\item{from}{matrix values equal to or smaller than \code{from} will be
associated with the first color of the color scale.}

\item{to}{values equal to or larger than \code{from} will be associated with
the last color of the color scale.}

\item{color_scale}{a vector of colors.}

\item{border}{color for rectangle borders (see \code{[graphics::rect()]}).}

\item{...}{further arguments to be passed to \code{[graphics::rect()]}.}
}
\description{
Creates a grid of colored or gray-scale rectangles. This function is similar
to \code{[graphics::image()]} when used for a matrix but simpler (\emph{i.e}
less available features).
}
\details{
This function actually draws rectangles to create an image from a matrix.
Unlike \code{[graphics::image()]}, \code{image2} the image is ordered just as the
matrix is displayed meaning that the cell (1,1) is at the upper left cell of
the plot drawn. Note that currently neither titles nor axes' labels are added
user should call the \code{[graphics::title()]} and \code{[graphics::axis()]}.
Concerning the latter, the user should be aware that cell's coordinates range
from 0 to 1 with 0 being the coordinates of the first cell and 1 the coordinates
of the last cell (if there is only one cell then the center of the unique cell
is 0).
